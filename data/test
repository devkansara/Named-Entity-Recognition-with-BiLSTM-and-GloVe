36 ,

8 higher

10 profits

13 share
14 could
15 be
16 but
17 said
18 sales
19 of
20 leading
21 Polish
22 brewers
23 should

1 He

9 in

12 about
13 55
14 percent
15 of

20 ,
21 could
22 all
23 raise

30 numerous

33 fall
34 to
35 competition
36 from
37 the
38 large
39 brewers
40 with

42 investors
43 .

1 Zywiec

1 Earlier

55 .

1 Van
2 Boxmeer
3 said
4 the
5 tough
6 competition
7 had
8 prevented
9 Zywiec
10 from
11 raising
12 prices
13 in
14 line
15 with
16 inflation
17 ,
18 which
19 had
20 added
21 to
22 the
23 pressure
24 on
25 the
26 firm
27 's
28 margins
29 .

1 He
2 said
3 advertising
4 costs
5 would
6 also
7 increase
8 in
9 the
10 fight
11 for
12 market
13 share
14 .

1 But
2 he
3 said
4 the
5 company
6 's
7 investment
8 of
9 more
10 than
11 $
12 100
13 million
14 already
15 this
16 decade
17 ,
18 largely
19 in
20 production
21 ,
22 would
23 help
24 position
25 it
26 to
27 compete
28 with
29 such
30 competitors
31 as
32 brewers
33 from
34 the
35 neighbouring
36 Czech
37 Republic
38 .

1 Some
2 analysts
3 say
4 cheaper
5 but
6 high-quality
7 Czech
8 imports
9 could
10 invade
11 Poland
12 once
13 tariffs
14 for
15 CEFTA
16 countries
17 are
18 lifted
19 in
20 1998
21 ,
22 but
23 van
24 Boxmeer
25 says
26 such
27 a
28 threat
29 might
30 be
31 exaggerated
32 despite
33 the
34 Czech
35 beer
36 market
37 's
38 overcapacity
39 .

1 "
2 I
3 think
4 Polish
5 consumers
6 in
7 general
8 are
9 quite
10 proud
11 of
12 their
13 beers
14 --
15 and
16 I
17 'm
18 speaking
19 about
20 all
21 the
22 brands
23 --
24 and
25 as
26 we
27 make
28 good
29 beers
30 ...

1 I
2 think
3 that
4 this
5 fidelity
6 to
7 our
8 beers
9 is
10 a
11 factor
12 which
13 can
14 limit
15 the
16 Czech
17 beers
18 ,
19 "
20 he
21 said
22 .

1 Van

3 said
4 Zywiec
5 had
6 its
7 eye
8 on
9 Okocim
10 ,
11 which
12 has
13 said
14 it
15 would
16 start
17 producing
18 Carlsberg
19 beer
20 next
21 year
22 ,
23 but
24 that
25 Zywiec
26 's
27 potential
28 production
29 of
30 Heineken
31 was
32 a
33 medium-term
34 possibility
35 rather
36 than
37 a
38 short-term
39 one
40 .

1 He
2 said
3 his
4 firm
5 would
6 be
7 better
8 off
9 concentrating
10 on
11 its
12 leading
13 brand
14 ,
15 Zywiec
16 Full
17 Light
18 ,
19 which
20 accounts
21 for
22 85
23 percent
24 of
25 sales
26 and
27 is
28 the
29 country
30 's
31 largest-selling
32 brand
33 .

18 "
19 van

24 that

29 up-market
30 import
31 in
32 Poland
33 .

1 Van

4 said

8 boosted
9 by
10 its
11 recent
12 shedding

1 The
2 British
3 government
4 warned
5 Friday
6 that
7 it
8 would
9 refer
10 the
11 proposed
12 trans-Atlantic
13 alliance
14 between
15 British
16 Airways
17 Plc
18 and
19 American
20 Airlines
21 to
22 Britain
23 's
24 Monopolies
25 and
26 Mergers
27 Commission
28 unless
29 the
30 carriers
31 complied
32 with
33 a
34 number
35 of
36 conditions
37 .

1 Trade
2 and
3 Industry
4 Secretary
5 Ian
6 Lang
7 added
8 that
9 even
10 if
11 the
12 conditions
13 were
14 met
15 by
16 both
17 airlines
18 ,
19 final
20 clearance
21 would
22 hinge
23 on
24 an
25 open
26 skies
27 deal
28 between
29 Britain
30 and
31 the
32 United
33 States
34 to
35 liberalise
36 trans-Atlantic
37 air
38 traffic
39 ,
40 which
41 would
42 create
43 greater
44 competition
45 on
46 the
47 routes
48 .

1 Lang
2 said
3 he
4 supported
5 conditions
6 proposed
7 by
8 Britain
9 's
10 Office
11 of
12 Fair
13 Trading
14 ,
15 which
16 was
17 asked
18 to
19 examine
20 the
21 case
22 last
23 month
24 .

1 "
2 I
3 agree
4 ...
5 that
6 without
7 suitable
8 undertakings
9 the
10 alliance
11 would
12 be
13 likely
14 to
15 lead
16 to
17 a
18 significant
19 loss
20 of
21 actual
22 and
23 potential
24 passengers
25 ,
26 on
27 those
28 routes
29 where
30 BA
31 and
32 AA
33 currently
34 compete
35 and
36 for
37 all
38 passengers
39 on
40 the
41 trans-Atlantic
42 market
43 route
44 between
45 the
46 UK
47 and
48 U.S.
49 ,

51 he
52 said

1 His
2 comments
3 came
4 just
5 minutes
6 after
7 the
8 latest
9 set
10 of
11 open
12 skies
13 talks
14 ended
15 in
16 London
17 with
18 no
19 deal
20 signed
21 .

1 Industry
2 sources
3 said
4 there
5 was
6 no
7 new
8 date
9 for
10 fresh
11 talks
12 and
13 blamed
14 the
15 deadlock
16 on
17 uncertainty
18 over
19 whether
20 the
21 British
22 Airways-American
23 deal
24 would
25 be
26 cleared
27 .

1 The
2 conditions
3 for
4 clearance
5 of
6 the
7 alliance
8 were
9 that
10 British
11 Airways
12 and
13 American
14 drop
15 168
16 slots
17 at
18 London
19 Heathrow
20 airport
21 ,
22 the
23 busiest
24 in
25 Europe
26 .

1 American
2 's
3 parent
4 ,
5 AMR
6 Corp.
7 ,
8 said
9 it
10 did
11 not
12 view
13 the
14 terms
15 as
16 a
17 "
18 deal
19 breaker
20 .
21 "

1 However
2 ,
3 it
4 called
5 the
6 conditions
7 "
8 more
9 severe
10 "
11 than
12 those
13 imposed
14 by
15 other
16 regulatory
17 authorities
18 on
19 similar
20 airline
21 alliances
22 .

1 British
2 Airways
3 's
4 initial
5 response
6 was
7 that
8 "
9 unconditional
10 divestiture
11 of
12 slots
13 is
14 unprecedented
15 and
16 if
17 done
18 it
19 must
20 be
21 on
22 the
23 basis
24 of
25 fair
26 market
27 value
28 .
29 "

1 It
2 added
3 that
4 it
5 would
6 be
7 "
8 prepared
9 to
10 take
11 reasonable
12 steps
13 to
14 assist
15 the
16 introduction
17 of
18 additional
19 competition
20 .
21 "

1 The
2 government
3 also
4 wants
5 British
6 Airways
7 to
8 drop
9 a
10 clause
11 in
12 its
13 agreement
14 with
15 USAir
16 that
17 bars
18 it
19 from
20 competing
21 on
22 trans-Atlantic
23 routes
24 ,
25 and
26 said
27 both
28 British
29 Airways
30 and
31 American
32 should
33 be
34 prepared
35 to
36 reduce
37 services
38 on
39 the
40 London
41 to
42 Dallas-Fort
43 Worth

46 the
47 event
48 that
49 a
50 new
51 entrant
52 wishes
53 to

55 .

1 It
2 also
3 suggested
4 losing
5 some
6 slots
7 on
8 the
9 London-to-Boston
10 route
11 .

1 The
2 Office
3 of
4 Fair
5 Trade
6 called
7 for
8 British
9 Airways
10 /
11 American
12 to
13 allow

11 any

17 Fe
18 would
19 be
20 a
21 "

24 ,
25 "
26 or
27 a
28 reluctantly
29 negotiated
30 agreement
31 where
32 the
33 buyer
34 is
35 not
36 necessarily
37 a
38 friendly
39 suitor
40 .

1 Newmont

6 had
7 previous
8 contact
9 ,
10 though
11 declined
12 to

14 the

1 Analysts
2 predict
3 Santa
4 Fe
5 will
6 go
7 to
8 the
9 highest
10 bidder
11 ,
12 and
13 that
14 if
15 a
16 rival
17 buyer
18 is
19 found
20 ,
21 Newmont
22 may
23 not
24 be
25 able
26 to
27 match
28 its
29 offer
30 .

1 They

3 the
4 Santa
5 Fe
6 deal
7 ,
8 which
9 includes
10 desirable
11 Nevada
12 mining
13 territory
14 ,
15 would
16 only
17 payoff
18 for
19 Newmont
20 longer
21 term
22 .

1 Newmont
2 ,
3 in

5 ,
6 will
7 not
8 benefit
9 from
10 the
11 Santa
12 Fe
13 acquisition
14 on
15 an
16 earnings
17 basis
18 for
19 at
20 least
21 two
22 years
23 ,
24 which
25 also
26 limits
27 its
28 capacity
29 to
30 raise
31 its
32 offer
33 .

1 Any
2 deal
3 ,
4 friendly
5 or
6 hostile
7 ,
8 would
9 almost
10 assuredly
11 be
12 a
13 stock
14 swap
15 ,
16 which
17 is

19 to

7 lowered
8 his
9 rating
10 on
11 Newmont
12 to
13 neutral
14 from
15 attractive
16 today
17 because
18 if
19 Newmont
20 merged
21 with
22 Santa
23 Fe
24 ,
25 investors
26 would
27 have
28 to

33 half
34 of

36 to
37 realize

40 .

2 I
3 think
4 Homestake
5 could
6 come
7 in

12 ,
13 but
14 how
15 much
16 is
17 someone
18 willing
19 to
20 come
21 in
22 above
23 the
24 Newmont
25 number
26 .

1 One
2 would
3 have
4 to
5 outbid
6 by
7 at
8 least
9 15
10 percent
11 ,
12 but
13 there
14 is
15 going
16 to
17 be
18 a
19 (
20 Santa

22 )
23 deal

7 Kabila
8 in
9 Goma
10 last
11 week
12 but
13 the
14 rebels
15 told
16 him
17 the
18 crisis
19 was
20 over
21 because
22 most
23 of
24 the
25 Rwandan
26 refugees
27 have
28 already
29 gone
30 home
31 .

1 The

3 do
4 not
5 want
6 the
7 multinational
8 force
9 to
10 deploy
11 on
12 the
13 ground
14 ,
15 for
16 fear
17 it
18 might
19 help
20 the
21 Zairean
22 army
23 regain
24 control
25 of
26 the

28 .

1 Kinshasa

2 Defence
3 Minister

7 on

16 have
17 to

19 food
20 airdrops
21 or

23 militarily
24 in

26 major
27 way
28 .

4 n't
5 look

9 (

11 )
12 are
13 going
14 to
15 be
16 required
17 in
18 any
19 significant
20 way
21 because
22 the

24 (

32 on

40 "
41 Young
42 told

44 .

1 But

3 Baril
4 said
5 it
6 would
7 be
8 premature
9 to
10 rule
11 out
12 any
13 course
14 of
15 action
16 until
17 he
18 had
19 more
20 information
21 .

1 "
2 We
3 hope
4 that
5 if
6 the
7 front
8 moves
9 forward
10 or
11 stabilises
12 then
13 we
14 will
15 have
16 access

2 If

4 ca
5 n't
6 move
7 because
8 they
9 are

38 that
39 fly

42 and
43 it
44 will
45 have
46 to
47 be
48 absolutely
49 necessary
50 .

1 If

1 Plastic

2 We

4 the

1 Stomach

2 The

1 One
